# Blog_Test
Java - Selenium - JUinit

Description:
This project is an integration test of an admin panel for a blog website. Testing was implemented using the Java programming language, the Selenium framework for web browser automation, and the JUnit framework for test execution.

The blog website's admin panel allows administrators to manage content, users, comments and other administrative functions. The goal of this testing is to verify that the admin panel is working properly and to identify potential problems or errors.

Instructions for running tests:
1. Download the project from the GitHub repository.
2. Open the project in a development environment (eg Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).
3. Ensure that all required libraries and dependencies are properly set up including the Java Development Kit (JDK), Selenium WebDriver and JUnit libraries.
4. Within the project, find and open the class that contains the integrated tests for the admin panel.
5. Configure Selenium WebDriver settings according to your system needs (eg web browser path, admin panel URL, etc.).
6. Run the tests by executing the class containing the tests or using the JUnit runner for automatic execution.
7. Review the test results to identify any errors or malfunctions.

Notes:
Before running the tests, make sure that the blog website admin panel is accessible and that the required test data is prepared.
This version of the tests is intended only for integrated testing of the admin panel. To test other parts of the website, additional tests or modules need to be added.
