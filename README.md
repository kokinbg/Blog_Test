# Blog_Test
Java - Selenium - JUinit

Description:
This project is an integration test of an admin panel for a blog website. Testing was implemented using the Java programming language, the Selenium framework for web browser automation, and the JUnit framework for test execution.

The blog website's admin panel allows administrators to manage content, users, comments, and other administrative functions. The goal of this testing is to verify that the admin panel is working properly and to identify potential problems or errors.

Folder Structure:
The repository consists of the following folders:

1. Blog Testing (Java - Selenium - JUnit): This folder contains code for the integration testing of the admin panel for the blog website. It utilizes the Java programming language in combination with the Selenium framework for web browser automation and the JUnit framework for test execution. Here, you will find all the classes and resources required for automated testing of the admin panel.

2. Manual Test Cases: In this folder, you will find manually created test cases for the blog website. These tests are designed to be executed manually without the use of automation. Here, you will find documents, tables, or other resources that describe the steps for manually testing different functionalities and scenarios on the website.

3. Additional Files: The "Additional Files" folder contains supplementary files that are relevant to the project but are not directly related to code or test cases. This may include design mockups, database diagrams, specifications, or any other relevant material that contributes to the understanding of the project.

Instructions for Running Tests:
1. Download the project from the GitHub repository.
2. Open the project in a development environment (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).
3. Ensure that all required libraries and dependencies are properly set up, including the Java Development Kit (JDK), Selenium WebDriver, and JUnit libraries.
4. Within the project, find and open the class that contains the integrated tests for the admin panel.
5. Configure Selenium WebDriver settings according to your system needs (e.g., web browser path, admin panel URL, etc.).
6. Run the tests by executing the class containing the tests or using the JUnit runner for automatic execution.
7. Review the test results to identify any errors or malfunctions.

Notes:
Before running the tests, make sure that the blog website admin panel is accessible and that the required test data is prepared.
This version of the tests is intended only for integrated testing of the admin panel. To test other parts of the website, additional tests or modules need to be added.
